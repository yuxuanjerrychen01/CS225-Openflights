## xx19, ruozhen2, kangyuf2, yuxuan19

### Communication

#### ● Team Meetings
Our team will meet twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday in person at Illini Tower.
Each team member will be assigned as the notetaker with xx19, ruozhen2, kangyuf2,
yuxuan19, respectively. At the end of the week, the note taker will also be
responsible for the first draft of the DEVELOPMENT LOG, reviewed by the other
three team members and uploaded by the notetaker.
#### ● Assistance
Each team member can be contacted through WeChat, phone calls, and Email.
Other than special emergencies and urgent matters, we commit to responding to
emails within 24 hours.
#### ● Respect
Each team member should respect each other during the meetings, including but not
limited to not interrupting the conversation, attending the meetings on time, and
listening carefully when other team members share their ideas.

### Collaboration


#### ● Work Distribution
The entire team will determine the necessary deliverables that we should accomplish
between each team meeting. Each team member will volunteer to work on one or
more deliverables; individual team members can team up to focus on a specific
subgoal if necessary. Any workload adjustments can be reasonably made according
to the particular circumstances, with the precondition of whole team approval.
#### ● Time Commitment
Each Team member is expected to commit at least 2 hours per week and 6 hours
maximum. The group is responsible for ensuring all team members have almost the
same commitment for the final project. If some people meet unsolvable problems,
other team members must help out and discuss issues together. The team should
spontaneously try their best to solve any technical problems or bugs during this
process. Asking TAs will be the last stage.
#### ● Conflict Resolution
If group members have any conflicting perspectives, they should provide logical
reasoning to their standpoints, and the minority should follow the majority. If we have
an equal number of people on both sides, each side should choose a person to play
Sudoku, and the quickest winner should make the final resolution.

### Agreement
xx19, ruozhen2, kangyuf2, and yuxuan19 all agree with the ground rules and the
remediation plan in this team contract.
