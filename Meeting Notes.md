(3) Add more features to the inner struct Airport, like latitude and longitude
(4) Change the passing argument of the Graph constructor from vector to file names
Data Cleaning and Data Prep

	Kangyu and Patrick: finish the Directed Graph constructor 
	Yuxuan and Ruozhen: finish the data cleaning and prep
